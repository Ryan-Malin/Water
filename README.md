<h1 align=center> Determining Water Potability
<h1 align=center> A Comparative Analysis

## About the Project
This project aims to provide a model to determine water potability. The raw data was initially processed using a variety of different approaches. Ultimately, the goal was to compare and evaluate the performance of regression and classification models using supervised and unsupervised machine learning (i.e., Key-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Supervised Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests (RFC), Logistic Regression, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the Automated Neural Network model).

## Roadmap
After completing preprocessing, our clean data set included 2011 samples connected with nine factors that affected water potability. Our approach trained four models of supervised machine learning namely K-nearest Neighbors, Supervised Vector Machine, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, as well as the Automated Neural Network Model for unsupervised machine learning. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of each of the machine learning methods we used against one another for best accuracy to successfully determine water potability.

## Statistical Feature
At the earliest stage of our project, measures of central tendency (mean and median) were used to determine values to fill blank spaces and null values in the dataset. However, When tested, no change was observed in the outcome after they were used with the same data. Correlation was similarly used in the project.

## Results
The accuracy score of each machine learning model that was used was as follows:

Keras-71%
SVM- 67%
KNN- 66%
RFC- 62%
LR-59%

Considering the low accuracy scores above, it was concluded that more time is needed to learn more about the data and to understand the relationship of all feature values with water potability. Even though five models were trained, none yielded good accuracy.
